# /shared UI

## Motivation 
Create samples, a library of components and modules that can be quickly taken and used in projects.

The current way is to copy and paste into your project.

Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui): *"This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps."*
